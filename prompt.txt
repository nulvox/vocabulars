Make a new flutter app in landscape orientation which accepts at buid time a directory structure with image and audio asset files along with a json file describing which images represent a scene and where a point of interaction sits in that scene. For each interaction point, there should be a label, 1 or more audio files speaking the word in a given language, and 0 or more translations of the label. If the given vocabulary app is multilingual, have a language drop-down at the top of every page. Keep the code well documented in both the README.md and inline comments and include a unit testing framework to ensure it keeps working properly as it is developed. Lastly, include an example json file and directory structure to prove the concept.
